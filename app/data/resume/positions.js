      abstract:"Data-intensive technologies, like AI, are increasingly widespread. We argue that the direction of innovation and growth \
                in data-intensive economies may be crucially shaped by the state because: (i) the state is a key collector of data and \
                (ii) data is sharable across uses within firms, potentially generating economies of scope. We study a prototypical \
                setting: facial recognition AI in China. Collecting comprehensive data on firms and government procurement contracts, \
                we find evidence of economies of scope arising from government data: firms awarded contracts providing access to more government \
                data produce both more government and commercial software. We then build a directed technical change model to study the implications \
                of government data access for the direction of innovation, growth, and welfare. We conclude with three applications showing how \
                data-intensive innovation may be shaped by the state: both directly, by setting industrial policy; and indirectly, by choosing \
                surveillance levels and privacy regulations.",

      abstract: "China’s rapidly increasing trade and investment into Africa has generated significant interest in China’s role in the continent’s political economy. \
                 As it displaces Africa’s traditional Western partners, China offers African nations an alternative development model to Western democracies. Critically, \
                 African locals may see China’s own rapid economic development under authoritarianism and challenge the conventional wisdom that democracy fosters growth \
                 and prosperity. Using data from China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) foreign investment database and local Afrobarometer polls across 36 countries, this \
                 project attempts to measure the role of Chinese economic engagement in shaping locals’ political ideology regarding democracy. Keywords in MOFCOM-registered project \
                 names are used to assign investments into their respective infrastructure sectors and geographic locations. Significant heterogeneity in Chinese investment across Africa \
                 suggests that regressions could reveal key factors driving how locals respond to Chinese projects in their vicinity. Analyzing Chinese investment projects across sectors, \
                 locations, time, and other variables may provide insights into how locals view Chinese engagement. Indeed, as China seeks to expand its role in the future, certain investment \
                 projects may prove more integral than others in swaying local populations to support China’s goal of developing long-term economic and political ties with Africa.",

      abstract:'Dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) have therapeutic promise due to their rapid proliferation and \
                multipotency but require further research to reach their full potential. Titanium dioxide \
                nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) possess properties for cell tracking and imaging, but their harmful \
                effects on cell viability and function pose roadblocks to their usage. This study investigates the \
                timing of TiO2 NP addition to DPSCs, a commonly neglected variable when testing NP toxicity, \
                and its effects on DPSC proliferation and differentiation. Based on preliminary testing, DPSCs \
                can respond to polybutadiene substrate mechanics after a 4-day incubation period. Accordingly, \
                we added TiO2 NPs on both days 1 and 4 (NP-1 and NP-4, respectively) after plating DPSCs on \
                hard polybutadiene films. Through the lens of mechanical properties, this study explores the \
                influence of time-mediated TiO2 NP addition and examines its effects on DPSC viability, \
                proliferation, and differentiation before and after recognition of polybutadiene-coated substrate. \
                Results showed that NP-4 had substantially reduced harm to DPSC proliferation and \
                differentiation as compared to NP-1, suggesting that time-mediated addition can prevent adverse \
                effects of TiO2 and NPs as a whole. These results can be translated to many other applications \
                including drug delivery, developmental biology, biosensing, and biological imaging.',
