#### Intro
I am a rising junior at Harvard University studying <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/applied-mathematics">Applied Math</a> with a focus in Economics and Computer Science with a secondary in Government. My interests range from journalism to data science, building web apps to sports modeling and betting, public policy to finance - if there's a problem that require rigorous and creative solutions, I'm fascinated!

<br>
I am interested in a variety of roles in investment, data science, software engineering and product management. I am particularly interested in social impact, education, public policy, and consumer-facing products. If you'd like to set up some time to chat, my email is <a href="mailto:richardzhu@college.harvard.edu">richardzhu@college.harvard.edu</a>
 and phone number is (952)-567-0108.

#### Currently
**Due to COVID-19 and its effect on the college experience, I am currently taking a gap year to explore my interests outside of school**. As such, I'm actively searching for new, exciting experiences to expand my horizons and am interested in working at fast-paced, dynamic companies in the tech and finance space. However, I would also love to gain experience working formally in areas that I'm passionate about in my free time - in sports, journalism, movies, and creative writing. If you have experience or opportunities in any of these areas, I would love to learn more about it - anything from a quick chat to a full-time role.

#### Some history

- My parents are both software engineers, but I wasn't able to use our home desktop computer until I was 5. I think it was because I didn't want to be like my parents. My first (and most consistent) usage
of the computer was to use our Zhu siblings' [Webkinz](https://www.webkinz.com/) account!

- At 6, I discovered how to use Microsoft PowerPoint to create hyperlinks to other slides, and created a choose-your-own adventure game for a school project about volcanoes.

- At 7, my parents bought me and my siblings a Nintendo DS for Christmas with the Pokemon Diamond game. My siblings and I accidentally blew our chance to get the legendary Pokemon Dialga because we listened to Team Galactic's warnings that Dialga was "too powerful".

- At 12, I discovered Clash of Clans, my first (and only) video game. I played the game for 5 years, and built up my village before selling it for $300. The game taught me patience, strategy, but most importantly the joy of building things progressively over time.

- At 13, I was a founding member of my high school's Public Forum debate team. It was the best decision I made in high school - it taught me how to think critically, research rigorously, speak confidently, and lead by example. Over five years, I grew from placing last at tournaments as a freshman to being ranked as a top 5 team in the country as a senior. I'm still involved in debate through Harvard's [parliamentary debate team](https://www.hcdu.org/) and coach my high school team (shoutout Edina Debate!).

- At 15 I wrote my first "Hello World!" in AP Computer Science class, and my journey with coding began!
